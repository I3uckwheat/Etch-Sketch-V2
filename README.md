# Etch-Sketch-V2
This project was wirtten as an assignment for Cody Loyd's JS 101 curriculum. Found here: https://the-odin-project.gitbooks.io/javascript-curriculum/content/JS101/introduction-101.html . 


This is the V2 of a similar project using jQuery that I had written for The Odin Project intro to web development course. I found the difficulty of using vanilla JS was very similar to jQuery and the idea of not having to include unnessessary code to accomplish something was valuable to me.

I found this project to be a great learning experience, understnding the DOM was vital to completing this. It also showed me what I didn't know and what I still need to work on. 


To run this code. Clone the repository, and open the "index.html" file in the browser. Alternatively, a live version is found here: https://i3uckwheat.github.io/Etch-Sketch-V2/
